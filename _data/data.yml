      - role: Research Assistant in Immunology
        time: Aug 2015 - May 2016
        company:  Autoimmune Therapeutics Institute at UMass Medical School, Worcester MA 
        details: |
           - Conducted experiments using flow cytometry, histology, and in vivo mouse models to investigate the efficacy of CXCR3-depleting antibodies in preventing and reversing vitiligo, contributing to insights into immune modulation and potential therapeutic strategies for autoimmune diseases.

           __Techniques:__
           - Flow Cytometry to analyze immune cell populations, particularly the depletion of CXCR3-expressing T cells in the skin and blood
           - Histology and Immunohistochemistry to examine skin tissue for melanocyte presence and immune cell infiltration, providing insights into the cellular changes induced by antibody treatment.
           - Western Blotting to detect CXCR3 within skin and immune cells.
           - ELISA to to measure cytokine levels and immune response markers in serum and tissue samples.


      - role: Research Assistant in Vaccine Immunology
        time: 2011 - 2013
        company: Vaccine Immunotherapy Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston MA 
        details: |
          - Performed experiments involving alginate microbead fabrication, islet isolation, and in vivo transplantation models to assess the efficacy of CXCL12-incorporated encapsulants in supporting long-term islet graft survival without systemic immune suppression, advancing innovative approaches to transplantation immunology. Documenting and presenting multidimensional quantitative data clearly and effectively for publication and peer review.

          __Techniques:__ 
          - Histology and Immunohistochemistry to examine transplanted tissue for immune cell infiltration, islet survival, and alginate bead integrity over time.
          - Flow Cytometry for analyzing immune cell populations in transplanted tissue or peripheral blood to assess immune response and effectiveness of immune modulation.
          - ELISA for measuring cytokine and chemokine levels, including CXCL12, to evaluate the immune environment around the transplanted islets.
          - Programmed 'Cellbot', automated cell counting program in Java and ImageJ, speeding data collection and lab efficiency 


          __Publication:__

              Alginate encapsulant incorporating CXCL12 supports long term allo and xenoislet transplantation without systemic immune suppression. *American Journal of Transplantation*, 2015. DOI 10.1111/ajt.13049 [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25693473/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25693473/)

      - role: Research Assistant in Medicinal Chemistry
        time: Jun 2009 - Jul 2011
        company: Tufts University Medford MA
        details: |
          - Developed and optimized direct O-glycosidation methods for resin-bound thioglycosides, enhancing glycosylation efficiency in carbohydrate chemistry research. The method streamlines the glycosidation process and has practical implications for both chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical applications. 

          - Utilized NMR and Mass Spectrometry to confirm product formation and purity.
