        details: |
          - Developed and optimized direct O-glycosidation methods for resin-bound thioglycosides, enhancing glycosylation efficiency in carbohydrate chemistry research. The method streamlines the glycosidation process and has practical implications for both chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical applications. 

          - Utilized NMR and Mass Spectrometry to confirm product formation and purity.
          
          - Publication:
              Direct O-glycosidation of resin bound thioglycosides. *Organic and Bimolecular Chemistry*, 2012.
                DOI: 10.1039/c2ob06883d  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22261792/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22261792/)

      - role: Research Assistant in Vaccine Immunology
        time: 2011-2013
        company: Vaccine Immunotherapy Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston MA 
        details: |
          - Performed experiments involving alginate microbead fabrication, islet isolation, and in vivo transplantation models to assess the efficacy of CXCL12-incorporated encapsulants in supporting long-term islet graft survival without systemic immune suppression, advancing innovative approaches to transplantation immunology. Documenting and presenting multidimensional quantitative data clearly and effectively for publication and peer review.

          Techniques: 
          - Histology and Immunohistochemistry to examine transplanted tissue for immune cell infiltration, islet survival, and alginate bead integrity over time.
          - Flow Cytometry for analyzing immune cell populations in transplanted tissue or peripheral blood to assess immune response and effectiveness of immune modulation.
          - ELISA for measuring cytokine and chemokine levels, including CXCL12, to evaluate the immune environment around the transplanted islets.
          - Programmed 'Cellbot', automated cell counting program in Java and ImageJ, speeding data collection and lab efficiency
