        company: Vaccine Immunotherapy Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston MA 
        details: |
          - Conducted research on a mycobacterial Hsp70-containing fusion protein targeting mesothelin, showing its ability to boost antitumor immunity and extend survival in mouse models of ovarian cancer and mesothelioma.

          - Conducted experiments with alginate microbead fabrication, islet isolation, and in vivo transplantation to evaluate how CXCL12-incorporated encapsulants support long-term islet graft survival without systemic immune suppression, advancing innovative approaches to transplantation immunology. Documented and presented detailed quantitative data for publication and peer review, contributing to innovative approaches in transplantation immunology.

          __Techniques:__ 
          - Histology and Immunohistochemistry to examine transplanted tissue for immune cell infiltration, islet survival, and alginate bead integrity over time.
          - Flow Cytometry for analyzing immune cell populations in peripheral blood to assess immune response and effectiveness of immune modulation.
          - ELISA for measuring cytokine and chemokine levels, including CXCL12, to evaluate the immune environment around the transplanted islets.
          - Protein Expression and Purification of mycobacterial Hsp70-containing fusion protein for experimental use
          - Developed 'Cellbot', an automated cell counting program in Java and ImageJ, speeding data collection and experimental validation 

          __Publication:__

             Alginate encapsulant incorporating CXCL12 supports long term allo and xenoislet transplantation without systemic immune suppression. *American Journal of Transplantation*, 2015. [DOI 10.1111/ajt.13049](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25693473/)
