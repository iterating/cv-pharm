        Inspired by studies and retrospectives classifying symptoms, disease risks, and associations, I was curious about the potential of applied statistical methods and reinforcement learning in this space back in 2013.  
        This experience equipped me with insight on potential and limitations of machine learning and AI to medicine and medical data that are still applicable today

    - role: Research Assistant in Immunology
      time: Aug 2015 - May 2016
      company: Autoimmune Therapeutics Institute at UMass Medical School, Worcester MA
      details: |
        - Conducted experiments using flow cytometry, histology, and in vivo mouse models to investigate the efficacy of CXCR3-depleting antibodies in preventing and reversing vitiligo, contributing to insights into immune modulation and potential therapeutic strategies for autoimmune diseases.

        __Bioinformatics:__
        - Searched online databases for information, background, methodologies. Experienced in crafting specific and relevant search queries using boolean logic. 

        __Techniques:__
        - Flow Cytometry to analyze immune cell populations and depletion of CXCR3-expressing T cells in the skin and blood
        - Histology and Immunohistochemistry to examine skin tissue for melanocyte presence and immune cell infiltration, providing insights into the cellular changes induced by antibody treatment.
        - Western Blotting to detect CXCR3 within skin and immune cells.
        - ELISA to to measure cytokine levels and immune response markers in serum and tissue samples.

    - role: Research Assistant in Vaccine Immunology
      time: Oct 2011 - May 2013
      company: Vaccine Immunotherapy Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston MA

        - Worked under Mark Poznansky helping develop a novel approach to transplant immunosuppression without systematic immunosuppression.
        - Isolated islet cells, encapsulated them in alginate containing Treg attractant CXCL12 and performed in vivo transplantation into diabetic mouse model. 
        - The blood glucose of experimental and control groups were then monitored and  statistically tested to evaluate how CXCL12-incorporated encapsulants supported islet graft survival. This demonstrated an innovative approach to transplant immunology where a chemokine that plays a role in protecting cancer cells from immune attack is instead applied to prolong survival of tranplant graft by locally attracting regulatory T cells and repelling cytotoxic T cells. 
        - Conducted research on a mycobacterial Hsp70-containing fusion protein targeting mesothelin, showing its ability to boost antitumor immunity and extend survival in mouse models of ovarian cancer and mesothelioma by attracting cytotoxic T cells to solid tumors. 

        __Communication and Presentation:__
        - Documented and presented quantitative data for publication and peer review, leading to successful publication.
        - Presented project, theory, and findings to both technical subject experts and general clinical audience at conferences including Massachusetts General Hospital Presentation Day and Digestive Disease Interventions. 


        __Techniques:__ 
        - Histology and Immunohistochemistry to examine transplanted tissue for immune cell infiltration, islet survival, and alginate bead integrity over time.
        - ELISA for measuring cytokine and chemokine levels, including CXCL12, to evaluate the immune environment around the transplanted islets.
        - Protein Expression and Purification of mycobacterial Hsp70-containing fusion protein for experimental use
        - Programmed 'Cellbot', an automated cell counting program in Java and ImageJ, speeding data collection and experimental validation 

        __Publication:__

          Alginate encapsulant incorporating CXCL12 supports long term allo and xenoislet transplantation without systemic immune suppression. *American Journal of Transplantation*, 2015. [DOI 10.1111/ajt.13049](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25693473/)

        - Worked under Dr.Clay Bennett to develop and optimize a direct O-glycosidation method for resin-bound thioglycosides, enhancing efficiency in carbohydrate chemistry research. This method streamlines the glycosidation process and has practical implications for both chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical applications. 

        - Utilized analytical techniques including NMR and Mass Spectrometry to confirm product formation and purity.
